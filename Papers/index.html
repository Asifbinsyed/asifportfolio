 <div id='jagadeesan22abstract'  class="abstractcollapsed">Language expressed in words expresses different
emotions in human beings. The same word can convey additional
meaning based on their emotions. Twitter has recently been
used in research to anticipate problems in the real world.
Researchers are investigating how social media might be used
to examine person-to-person communication regarding health
and healthcare as society gets more networked. Many data-
mining techniques are used to monitor public health, including
user classification, sentiment analysis, and tweet classification.
This research aims to identify persons with potential risks of
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) from their expressed emotions
through Tweets with the help of Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). CVD is a broad term for
illnesses affecting the heart or blood vessels. After preprocessing,
the vectorized dataset is loaded into ML and Deep Learning
(DL) models. The performance has been evaluated based on
several parameters like Test Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1,
Mathew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Cohen’s Kappa
(CK) score. The tweets have been collected from eighteen US
states, including the thirteen Appalachian states and five nearby
states. The results have also been compared at this state level
with those obtained from the CDC dataset, which contains some
demographic information.<br></div>

   <div id='jagadeesan22abstract'  class="abstractcollapsed">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education is a recent 
    development, with chatbots emerging as a noteworthy addition to this transformative landscape. As online learning platforms 
    rapidly advance, students need to adapt swiftly to excel in this dynamic environment. Consequently, understanding the acceptance
     of chatbots, particularly those employing Large Language Model (LLM) such as Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT), 
     Google Bard, and other interactive AI technologies, is of paramount importance. However, existing research on chatbots in education 
     has overlooked key behavior-related aspects, such as Optimism, Innovativeness, Discomfort, Insecurity, Transparency, Ethics, 
     Interaction, Engagement, and Accuracy, creating a significant literature gap. To address this gap, this study employs Partial 
     Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the determinant of chatbots adoption in education among students,
      considering the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Utilizing a five-point Likert scale for 
      data collection, we gathered a total of 185 responses, which were analyzed using R-Studio software. We established 12 hypotheses 
      to achieve its objectives. The results showed that Optimism and Innovativeness are positively associated with Perceived Ease 
      of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU). Conversely, Discomfort and Insecurity negatively impact PEOU, with only Insecurity 
      negatively affecting PU. Furthermore, PEOU, PU, Interaction and Engagement (IE), Accuracy, and Responsiveness (AR) all 
      significantly contribute to the Intention to Use (IOE), whereas Transparency and Ethics (TE) have a negative impact on IOE. 
      Finally, IOE mediates the relationships between Interaction, Engagement, Accuracy, Responsiveness, Transparency, Ethics, and 
      Perception of Decision Making (PDM). These findings provide insights for future technology designers, elucidating critical user 
      behavior factors influencing chatbots adoption and utilization in educational contexts.<br></div>

<div id='garg_word_2018abstract'  class="abstractcollapsed">In marine surveillance, distinguishing between normal and anomalous vessel movement patterns is 
critical for identifying potential threats in a timely manner. Once detected, it is important to monitor and track these vessels until a necessary 
intervention occurs. To achieve this, track association algorithms are used, which take sequential observations comprising geological and motion parameters 
of the vessels and associate them with respective vessels. The spatial and temporal variations inherent in these sequential observations make the association task challenging for traditional multi-object tracking algorithms. Additionally,
 the presence of overlapping tracks and missing data can further complicate the trajectory tracking process<br></div>

<div id='garg_impact_2015abstract'  class="abstractcollapsed">For decades, track association has been a challenging problem in marine surveillance, which involves the identification and association of vessel observations over time. However, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has provided a new opportunity for researchers to tackle this problem by offering a large database of dynamic and geo-spatial information of marine vessels. With the availability of such large databases, researchers can now develop sophisticated models and algorithms that leverage the increased availability of data to address the track association challenge effectively. Furthermore, with the advent of deep learning, track association can now be approached as a data-intensive problem. In this study, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based multi-model framework for track association. LSTM is a recurrent neural network architecture that is capable of processing multivariate temporal data collected over time in a sequential manner, enabling it to predict current vessel locations from historical observations. Based on these predictions, a geodesic distance based similarity metric is then utilized to associate the unclassified observations to their true tracks (vessels). We evaluate the performance of our approach using standard performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, which provide a comprehensive summary of the accuracy of the proposed framework.<br></div>
